For one of my first practical soldering project I decided to try replacing the save data battery in a generation 2 Pokemon game, since it would be a simple project to start with and I remeber those games fondly from my childhood.

I picked up a Japanese copy of Pokemon Silver from Ebay, which had a dead save battery that prevented it from keeping its save data when turned off. I confirmed using a GameBoy Advance that the cartridge would play the game, but after saving, turning the handheld off for a few seconds, and turning it back on, the save data would no longer be there.

In order to replace the battery I needed to get a replacement battery and a screwdriver that would be able to remove the screw on the back of the cartridge that holds it together. I was able to find a nice set on Amazon for ~$14 USD that included a few replacement batteries and a screwdriver with 2 bits, one of which that supported the GBC cartridge screws.
